- WHEWWW. I was debugging an issue with importing a module. I went through a lot and went down some paths that seemed promising but ultimately did not fix my issue.
Eventually i looked at a tutorial for a todo list in typescript by web dev simplified and he mentioned that I'll need to use a bunder to do node imports. And, by golly it worked.

- HTTP request options can be typed as `RequestInit`

- Try/Catch is not a substitude for async/await or .then().catch()... Dont forget to use it in Express when dealing with Mongoose.

- For fetch request you will need to add async.await anywhere its used me thinks.

- My error with the clear button was solved because I seen that i was using similar paths for my delete HTTP methods. I put the hard coded end point before the one that uses parameters and it worked. Also, before that I needed to add e.preventDefault() for the clear button in my js/ts.


- Conclusion

I learned a lot about TypeScript by
    1. Watching a course
    2. Going through the docs
    3. Watching youtube videos about the basics and topics that I wanted a better understandig of.
    4. Creating a small project that will help me get the hang of it and expose the gaps in my knowledge

I really enjoy TypeScript for it's code completion, and its ability to catch bugs before compile-time.
